# Sem-2-Project

STUDYSTAT USING SDL IN C++

The project is about tracking the study time of a student.  

## Some key features

- We have added a relaxing music at the break time for the student to get calm
- Here we also had a feature of stop and restarting the timer from the same point.

## Future Plans
- We are now working to make the whole code a user interface by also integrating with another language.
- Applying to the pan INDIA level by making it efficient to everyone
-  It will ask the domain you belong to whether a teacher ,a studnet or someone.
-  We are also trying to add a feature of add videos in to it along with the images and files.
-  We will also add the data of many students so that we can also had a feature of comparison which helps the student to motiiavte
-  We can also connect a personal chatbot with it that helps them in asking doubts at anytime
